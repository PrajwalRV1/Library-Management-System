# Library-Management-System
A web-based complete backend oriented application utilizing springboot, spring web, spring Data JPA, Hibernate and Mysql to manage library operations efficiently by facilitating streamlined management of library tasks like Cataloging, Borrowing, and Returning books.

 -> Approach : MVC(Model view Control) Architecture.
 -> Tech-stack : Spring web, springboot, JPA & Hibernate, MySQL, PostMan for API testing, InteliJIdea (IDE).
 -> Features : developed main viable product(MVP) features
 - Book Management : Add, edit, delete books
 - User Management : register, update user
 - Borrowing and Returning : issue book to users, track borrowed books and due dates,, allow user to return book within 7 days, after 7 days add fine 5rs/per day to the user until he returns the book.
 - JUnit & Mockito unit Testing : used Mockito framework to test and validate the business logic of individual units, and although the APIs are lightweight, I tested them to verify their function call.
